In my solution I've created a shellcode based on ROP method which we learned In the class.
the shellcode is actions is get the adrress of global variable auth (using IDA).
then I've put in register value 1.
and then put the value 1 in address of auth.
after that I wrote the return address in the main.so the program will go back to main and print Victory.

concat all this command,using ROP logic will make it command by command.
